## App
This project prints "Devops is great" to adapt to the environment you are running in (in this example we are talking about localhost)

## Pipline

## Environment Variables in Jenkinsfile

Inside the jenkinsfile we have some Environment Variables that are important to refer to.

#### Test related
`IP`
`PORT`
#### Tag related
`TAG`
`TAGcommit`
#### Notice related
`NAME`
`EMAIL`
## Jenkins CI
#### Pull
- Completely deletes the old environment(deleteDir()).
- Pulling the code from the github repository(checkout scm).

#### Build

- Building the app.

#### Test

- Doing tests on an application.

#### Tag calculation

- We will enter this stage only if the commit also has "#tag", This stage was created to give Jenkins the responsibility to perform version control.

- that stage handles end conditions, For example if the developer sends a tag and "#tag"

#### Tag validity

- Checking the history of the tag including the new ones (in case they were pushed).

#### Publish
- Notifies whether the CI passed or not.
